# Who’s “GLaDOS”?
GLaDOS is an AI character in the video games *Portal* and *Portal 2*. 

# Then what is this?
ApertureScience.com used to have a Flash app that simulated logging into GLaDOS from the terminal. This command-line program simulates that simulator. 

It isn’t supposed to be useful. It’s just a fun project for practicing C++.
